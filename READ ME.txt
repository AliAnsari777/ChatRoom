This is my final project for the bachelor's degree. It was my first experience creating a whole project all by myself. 
I designed, developed, and debugged the whole project by myself, and because I didn’t have that much experience I didn’t use any special
framework or specific design pattern. This project is made by PHP, JQuery, HTML 5, CSS 3, and MySQL.
This project has lots of shortage but for the first time it was a good experience and I learned lots of things from it.
I should also mention that I received the best mark from my project.
